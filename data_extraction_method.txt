# Data Extraction Methodology

------------------------

## Step 1: County List Extraction

1. Automated Web Navigation

   * A Selenium WebDriver was used to programmatically navigate the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) multi-screen interface.
   * Each U.S. state (52 options including territories) was iterated, and the "Counties and equivalents" option was selected where available.

2. County Information Retrieval

   * For each state, all county-level entries were extracted from dropdown menus and stored as records (`State`, `County`).
   * Each county entry was then parsed and structured into:

     * County Code
     * County Name
     * County State

3. Data Cleaning & Structuring

   * Extracted values were cleaned (e.g., whitespace removal).
   * The resulting county list was used as the foundation for further data retrieval.

## Step 2: BLS Data Extraction & Processing

1. Series ID Generation

   * Each county’s code was converted into a BLS-compatible series ID using a standardized format (`LAUCN + county_code + 03`).
   * This ensured compatibility with the BLS SurveyOutputServlet API.

2. Data Retrieval via API

   * A POST request was submitted to the BLS `SurveyOutputServlet` endpoint for each series ID.
   * Data was requested for the full available time range (1990–2025).
   * The API response contained county-level labor force and unemployment measures.

3. Catalog Metadata Extraction

   * Each API response included metadata tables (e.g., Area, Area Type, State/Region/Division, Measure, Seasonal adjustment).
   * These values were parsed using BeautifulSoup and stored alongside time-series data.

4. Time-Series Data Structuring

   * Monthly and yearly values (Jan–Dec per year) were extracted into tabular format using Pandas.
   * Each dataset was enriched with metadata (`series_id`, `Area`, `Measure`, etc.) for clarity.

5. Batch Processing & Backup

   * Data was fetched iteratively for all counties.
   * Intermediate backups were saved at fixed intervals to ensure data integrity during long runs.

6. Final Data Consolidation

   * All extracted datasets were combined into a single master dataset.
   * The final structured output was delivered as 'MASTER_SHEET.xlsx'
